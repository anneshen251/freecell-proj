# freecell-proj
Project files for Freecell, a game similar to solitare

Player moves cards from randomly generated decks into four empty spaces in order to complete a full cascade of each suit. There 
are three types of piles (open, cascade, foundation). The game works by reading string input then writing to an appendable the result of
the input. The game ends when all cards are in each of the four foundation piles. Some rules are set in place such as there could only 
be one card in an open pile and to move a card back into a foundation pile it has to be one less than the last card of the pile and an alternating color.
